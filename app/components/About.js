              I specialize in building mobile responsive front-end UI applications
              that connect with APIs and other backend technologies. Iâ€™m
              passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is
              more than one way to accomplish a task. Though I am most proficient
              in building front-end applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
              React, I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as
              needed. I believe that being a great developer is not using one
              specific language, but choosing the best tool for the job.

              I started web development in 2013 managing multiple e-commerce
              websites on CMS platforms such as WordPress, BigCommerce, and
              Shopify. I have experience working directly with clients and taking
              mock wireframes all the way to deployed applications. In my spare
              time, I run Code Commerce, a Youtube channel where I teach web
              development and various front-end technologies.
